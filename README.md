# Morse Code Tutor
This program is a desktop app designed to teach people how to tap and interpret international Morse Code with various modes. The modes include translation between text and Morse Code, a basic tutorial
for beginners, and game modes to practice interpreting and tapping Morse Code. Morse Code can be played at customizable speed, and Farnsworth timing can be enabled as well. During modes involving
tapping out Morse Code, live feedback is shown on screen and statistics are collected from user input to help you improve your timing. Additionally, there is a game mode to learn a couple Q-codes and
abbreviations commonly used in Morse Code communication. You can learn Morse Code from scratch, practice interpreting and tapping Morse Code faster, or simply translate text into Morse Code or vice
versa. This program is written in C++ and utilizes SDL2. It was developed with Visual Studio 2017.

## How to Install and Run
Inside "Release", download morseCodeTutor.exe, SDL2.dll, SDL2_ttf.dll, and source-code-pro.ttf, and run the executable. The other files in "Release" are optional. This program is compatible with
Windows 10. Other operating systems have not been tested on.

## Credits
This project was made with the help of Jeffrey Saied and Katherine Stadnyk. Jeff worked on interpreting Morse Code taps from the user and the game modes for "Tapping Morse Code". Katherine worked on
translating ASCII into a Morse Code sequence, the game modes for "Hearing Morse Code" and "Learn Q-codes & Abbreviations", and the menuing for the game modes. They both contributed to the
conceptualization and design of the various modes. This project began as a "Project Lab" assignment at Texas Tech University and was initially developed on an Arduino Mega with other hardware
peripherals.
